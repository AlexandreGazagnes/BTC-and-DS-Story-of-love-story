# BTC_and_DS_first_date
<p>_ Hello, I'm Data Science ! 
</p><p>_ Hello Data Science, I am Bitcoin!
</p><p>_ Nice to meet you Bitcoin, you can call me 'DS'
</p><p>_ OK, DS, what are you? 
</p><p>_ I am a not so new discipline, a mix of computer science, algebra, statistics, probalibilites, and data. I am triying to help humans to give sense to their huge amount of data, helping them to understand it, drawing corelations, even making some probabilistic predictions. And you Bitcoin, what are you?
</p><p>_ How, sorry, I am not so good in this exercice. You know, I am to financial system what Internet was to communications. I am highly speculative, lots of people talk about me, but very few try to undestand me and my capacities, "skam ou global revolution?" that how medias define me in general.
</p><p>_ Medias do not understand me neiter, they just refer to me with "Big Brother" or "Orwell right hand"!
</p><p>_ What is very fun with me are my prices : they are very, very hard to predict, very volatile and so the volume of my trades is also very volatile.
</p><p>_ Very good! Just to ask, to you have huge amout of free and reliable data we can easily obtain?
</p><p>_ Yes, I can give you all my prices, second per second since 2012 in 3 seconds ! 
</p><p>_ Oh Oh Oh, very interessing... Would you spend few python code lines with me?
</p><p>_ Of course, I am sure we can spend good time!
</p><p>_ Me to, my freind, me to!</p>
